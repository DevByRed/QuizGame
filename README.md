<h1 align="center">🧠 QuizGame</h1>
<br>

**QuizGame** is a clean, responsive, and fully interactive quiz application developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.  
The project was designed to strengthen my front-end skills and deepen my understanding of DOM manipulation, dynamic UI updates, and component-based design.

This project was initially inspired by the tutorial:  
👉 [HTML, CSS & JavaScript Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAiX0itnonM),  
which I then customized with my own layout, logic, visuals, and structure.

> ⚠️ This is a **front-end only** application — all questions and logic run directly in the browser, with no database or backend.
